# Regression Log

A running record of production bugs, their root causes, and the tests that prevent them from recurring.
Update this file whenever a bug is fixed: add the bug, cause, fix, and test reference.

## 2026-03-26 — 429 on `/api/demo-scenario` and dashboard hydration

**Symptom**: `GET /api/demo-scenario` returned 429 (Too Many Requests) on Vercel; dashboard loads could fail alongside other `/api/*` calls.

**Root cause**: The global IP rate limiter applied to almost every API route. Paths such as `/api/demo-scenario`, `/api/tokens/*`, and session/OAuth status endpoints were **not** excluded (unlike `/api/accounts/my` / `/api/transactions/my`). Shared IPs or a low `RATE_LIMIT_MAX` exhausted the 15‑minute window during normal SPA hydration.

**Fix**: `shouldSkipGlobalRateLimit()` in `server.js` now excludes `/api/demo-scenario`, `/api/tokens`, `/api/auth/session`, `/api/auth/oauth/status`, and `/api/auth/oauth/user/status`. The UI coalesces concurrent `fetchDemoScenario()` calls to avoid duplicate GETs (e.g. React Strict Mode).

**Tests**: No dedicated rate-limit unit test; behavior verified in production. Client dedupe is in `demoScenarioService.js`.

## 2026-03-26 — 401 on `/api/accounts/my` while OAuth status looked signed-in

**Symptom**: After login, `GET /api/auth/oauth/user/status` could show `authenticated: true` while `GET /api/accounts/my` returned 401.

**Root cause**: `refreshIfExpiring` (RFC 6749 silent refresh) ran only on routes like `/api/accounts` and **not** on `/api/auth/oauth/*`. The OAuth status handlers only checked that a non–`_cookie_session` access token **existed**, not that it was still valid. `authenticateToken` on data routes validates the JWT with PingOne — expired tokens failed there first.

**Fix**: Apply `refreshIfExpiring` to the `/api/auth/oauth` path prefix in `server.js` so tokens refresh before OAuth status and related handlers run.

**Tests**: Existing `tokenRefresh` / OAuth integration coverage; manual verification on Vercel.

## 2026-03-25 — Redis cold-start 500 on `/api/accounts/my`

**Symptom**: "Failed to load your account information" banner after login.  
**Error log**: `{"error":"server_error","error_description":"An internal server error occurred","path":"/api/accounts/my"}`

**Root cause**:  
`RedisStore.get()` was calling `cb(err)` when Upstash had not yet completed its TLS handshake.
`express-session` propagated that error to Express's `next(err)`, which `oauthErrorHandler` converted to a 500.

**Fix**:  
Wrapped `RedisStore.get/set/destroy` in `services/faultTolerantStore.js`.
`get` errors return `cb(null, null)` (empty session → 401); `set`/`destroy` errors are logged and `cb(null)` is called.

**Tests**:  
`src/__tests__/session-store-resilience.test.js` — `faultTolerantStore wrapper` suite.

## 2026-03-25 — `?error=session_error` on customer sign-in

**Symptom**: Clicking "Customer Sign-In" on the homepage redirected to `/login?error=session_error` instead of PingOne.

**Root cause**:  
`oauthUser.js /login` called `req.session.save()` to persist the PKCE state.
When Redis was slow on a cold start the save callback received `err`, and the route responded with `res.redirect('/login?error=session_error')` before the user reached PingOne.
The PKCE state was already stored in a signed cookie (the fallback), so the session save was not essential.

**Fix**:  
Changed the `session.save()` callback in `/login` to log a `console.warn` and redirect to PingOne regardless of the error.
Applied the same non-fatal pattern to `session.regenerate()` and `session.save()` in the `/callback` routes of both `oauthUser.js` and `oauth.js`.

**Tests**:  
`src/__tests__/oauth-login-resilience.test.js` — `oauthUser /login — session.save() resilience` suite.

## 2026-03-25 — Eager Redis connect race condition

**Symptom**: Even with fault-tolerant store wrappers, the first cold-start request would block for ~8 s waiting for Redis to connect, and subsequent requests raced against a connect that had not started yet.

**Root cause**:  
`redisClient.connect()` was called lazily inside `awaitSessionRedisReady` (the first request middleware), meaning every cold start incurred the full TLS handshake latency on the hot path.

**Fix**:  
`redisClient.connect()` is now called **eagerly at module load time** in `server.js`, storing the promise as `_redisConnectPromise`.
`awaitSessionRedisReady` simply awaits the already-in-flight promise rather than issuing a new connect.
This allows the TLS handshake to overlap with the remaining Express startup cost.

**Tests**:  
`src/__tests__/session-store-resilience.test.js` — `awaitSessionRedisReady middleware` suite.

## 2026-03-25 — `userEmail: null` in session debug

**Symptom**: `/api/auth/debug` returned `"userEmail": null` even though the user had an email in PingOne.

**Root cause**:  
PingOne's `/userinfo` endpoint did not return the `email` claim because the attribute mapping had not been configured in the PingOne application.
`oauthService.createUserFromOAuth()` only looked at `userInfo.email`, so the email was null.

**Fixes applied**:
1. `oauthUser.js` callback decodes the ID token and merges its claims into `userInfo` before calling `createUserFromOAuth`, providing a fallback when `/userinfo` is incomplete.
2. `oauthService.createUserFromOAuth()` also checks `userInfo.email_address` (PingOne alternate claim) before giving up.
3. User configured the PingOne attribute mapping (permanent fix at the IdP level).

**Tests**:  
`src/__tests__/oauthService.test.js` — `createUserFromOAuth — email / name fallbacks` suite.

## 2026-03-25 — E2E scope tests incorrectly asserted 403 on `/my` dashboard routes

**Symptom**: CI failures: two tests in `oauth-e2e-integration.test.js` expected 403 on `/api/accounts/my` and `/api/transactions/my` when called with a write-only or accounts-read-only token.

**Root cause**:  
The tests were written assuming scope enforcement applied to all routes.
The `/my` routes are intentionally **scope-free** (BFF dashboard pattern): any authenticated user can read their own data regardless of which scopes are in the Bearer token.
Scope enforcement is only applied to admin/collection endpoints (`GET /api/transactions`, `GET /api/accounts`, etc.).

**Fix**:  
Updated the two tests to:
- Assert 200 on `/api/accounts/my` and `/api/transactions/my` for any valid token.
- Assert 403 on `GET /api/transactions` (collection endpoint) to verify that scope enforcement still works.

**Tests**:  
`src/__tests__/oauth-e2e-integration.test.js` — `Scope-based Access Control in E2E Flow` suite.

## Rule: Test Every Bug Fix

When fixing a production bug:
1. Add an entry here describing the symptom, root cause, and fix.
2. Write (or update) a focused unit test that reproduces the bug and verifies the fix.
3. Run the full suite (`npm test` in `banking_api_server/`) before committing.
4. The PR description must reference the test file and test name.
