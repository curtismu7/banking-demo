## Elevator Pitch

**BX Finance** is a production-grade AI banking demo that shows PingOne doing real identity work — not simulated. Every time the AI agent moves money or reads account data, a live RFC 8693 token exchange fires, PingOne issues a narrow-scoped MCP token, and the full delegation chain is visualised in the browser in real time.

It's the answer to *"Show me how PingOne secures an AI agent."*

---

## Key Demo Scenarios

### UC-A — Standard Login (OAuth 2.0 / OIDC)
User visits the marketing page, clicks **Log In**, authenticates at PingOne, and lands on the dashboard with a live session. Under the hood: Auth Code + PKCE, `state` + `nonce` CSRF protection, ID token validation, refresh token rotation — all surfaced in the **Token Chain** panel.

**What to show:** Token Chain panel → expand the login event → see `access_token`, `id_token`, `refresh_token` scope and audience side by side.

---

### UC-B — Step-Up MFA on High-Value Transactions (CIBA / OTP)
The AI agent attempts a transfer over the threshold (default **$500**). PingOne issues a backchannel auth challenge via CIBA — an email OTP is sent to the user. The agent waits. The user enters the code in the approval modal. The agent resumes automatically with an elevated token.

**What to show:** Ask the agent *"Transfer $600 from Checking to Savings"* → watch the CIBA challenge appear → enter the OTP → transaction completes.

> Toggle between CIBA push and email OTP via `STEP_UP_METHOD` in Admin → Config.

---

### UC-C — AI Banking Agent (MCP + LangChain)
The Banking Agent understands natural language. Ask it to check balances, transfer money, explain a transaction, or look up another user. It uses a LangChain/Groq pipeline with an OpenAI-compatible model and routes every banking tool call through the MCP server.

**Demoable commands:**
- *"What's my checking balance?"*
- *"Transfer $50 from Savings to Checking"*
- *"Show me my last 5 transactions"*
- *"Find the account for user@example.com"*

**Agent layouts:** Float, left-dock, right-dock, bottom-dock — all resizable.

---

### UC-D — RFC 8693 Token Exchange (MCP Tool Delegation)
Every time the agent calls a banking tool, the BFF exchanges the user's session token for a narrow-scoped MCP token. PingOne does the exchange — the browser never sees a token.

**Two delegation paths:**

| Path | How it works | Token has |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **1-Exchange** | User token → MCP token | `sub=user`, `aud=banking_mcp_01` |
| **2-Exchange** | User token + Agent actor token → MCP token | `sub=user`, `aud=banking_mcp_01`, `act={sub:agent_client_id}` |

The **Token Chain** panel visualises every step live — subject token in, exchanged token out, scope narrowing shown as badge diff.

---

### UC-E — Family Delegation (`may_act` / `act` claim)
A parent account can delegate access to a child/spouse. The delegated user's token carries `may_act: { client_id: <bff> }` injected by PingOne. The BFF uses this as authorisation to perform the token exchange on their behalf. The `act` claim in the resulting MCP token records the full delegation chain per RFC 8693 §4.1.

**What to show:** Log in as the delegated user → initiate a transfer → Agent Flow Diagram shows the `act` claim chain.

---

### UC-F — Sensitive Data Access (PingOne Authorize)
Certain agent actions (e.g., viewing full account numbers or accessing regulated data) require an explicit PingOne Authorize (PAZ) policy decision. The BFF calls the PAZ evaluation endpoint before executing the tool. Access is denied without a matching policy decision — surfaced as a 403 in the Agent Flow Diagram.

**What to show:** Admin → Config → enable PingOne Authorize → trigger a sensitive query → watch the PAZ gate fire in the flow diagram.

---

### UC-G — Self-Service PingOne Setup (Management API)
First-time setup provisions the entire PingOne environment automatically: creates OIDC applications, resource servers, and scopes via the PingOne Management API using a worker token. No manual console clicks required.

**What to show:** Admin → Setup Wizard → enter env ID + worker credentials → watch apps and scopes provision in real time.

---

### UC-H — Admin / Ops Console (Token Debug + OAuth Log)
The admin dashboard exposes:
- **Token Chain Visualiser** — live token events per action with RFC citations
- **Agent Flow Diagram** — per-step authorisation breakdown with pass/fail status
- **Verbose OAuth Log** — every HTTP call the BFF makes to PingOne
- **MCP Inspector** — tools/list via live WebSocket, connection status
- **API Viewer** — raw request/response for every banking operation
- **Config Panel** — all feature flags, PingOne settings, exchange modes, Vercel env vars

## What Makes This Different

| Claim | Why it's true |
|-------|--------------|
| **Token exchange is real, not mocked** | Every agent tool call fires a live `POST /token` with `grant_type=token-exchange` to PingOne — visible in the OAuth log |
| **Token Chain shows the live delegation chain** | Not a diagram — it's the actual token events from the current session, with RFC citations and scope diff |
| **Agent Flow Diagram shows per-step auth** | See exactly which step passed or failed and why, in real time |
| **21 in-context education panels** | Every feature has an RFC explainer panel that opens next to the running demo — no context switching |
| **Multi-vertical out of the box** | Retail banking and HR workforce variants with one config toggle |
| **Self-provisioning** | New environments set up in minutes with the setup wizard — not hours of manual console work |
| **Honest about complexity** | Feature flags surface advanced flows; defaults work without PingOne setup for basic demos |

## 20-Minute Demo Checklist

For a tight presales demo, cover these five things in order:

1. **Login (2 min)** — Log in via PingOne. Open Token Chain → show `access_token`, `id_token`, scopes. *"The browser never sees a token — only a session cookie."*

2. **AI Agent + Token Exchange (5 min)** — Ask *"What's my balance?"* → Token Chain shows the exchange request + narrow MCP token. *"PingOne just issued a token scoped only to the MCP server — on demand, per call."*

3. **High-Value Transfer + Step-Up (5 min)** — Ask *"Transfer $600 to Savings."* → CIBA challenge fires → email OTP → transaction completes. *"The AI agent couldn't move that money without the user approving on a second channel."*

4. **Agent Flow Diagram (3 min)** — Click the flow diagram icon. Walk through each step — PKCE login, exchange, PAZ gate, MCP tool call, result. *"Every hop is authorised. The agent can't skip any step."*

5. **Education Panel (2 min)** — Click the RFC 8693 panel. Show the spec text next to the live token. *"This isn't a demo of what PingOne could do — every RFC reference here is live right now."*

6. **Config depth (3 min)** — Show Admin → Config: toggle 2-exchange, change LLM provider, enable PAR, switch vertical. *"One config file — no code changes."*

## Deployment Options

| Option | Session store | Setup |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **Local dev** | SQLite / in-memory | `npm start` in each package |
| **Vercel** | Upstash Redis (required) | `docs/VERCEL_SETUP.md` |
| **Docker / K8s** | Redis | *(planned — Phase 55)* |
