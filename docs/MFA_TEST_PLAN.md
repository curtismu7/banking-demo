# MFA Test Plan — OTP and FIDO

## Overview

This test plan provides comprehensive testing procedures for Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) in the Super Banking demo, focusing on OTP (One-Time Password) and FIDO2/WebAuthn methods.

## Test Objectives

- Verify OTP MFA flow works end-to-end
- Verify FIDO2 MFA flow works end-to-end
- Test MFA trigger conditions (high-value transactions, sensitive operations)
- Validate error handling and edge cases
- Ensure user experience is smooth and intuitive

## Prerequisites

- Super Banking demo application running locally or deployed
- PingOne environment configured with MFA policy
- Test user account with MFA device registered
- Test email account for OTP delivery
- FIDO2 security key (for FIDO2 testing)
- Browser supporting WebAuthn (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Test Environment Setup

### 1. PingOne MFA Policy Configuration

Ensure the following are configured in PingOne:

**Policy Settings:**
- Policy Name: `Super Banking Step-Up MFA Policy`
- Policy Type: Device Authentication
- Required Factors: 1
- Allowed Methods: OTP, FIDO2, Push
- Session Lifetime: 15 minutes

**OTP Configuration:**
- OTP Length: 6 digits
- OTP Lifetime: 5 minutes
- Maximum Attempts: 3
- Lockout Duration: 15 minutes

**FIDO2 Configuration:**

### 2. Environment Variables

Set the following in `banking_api_server/.env`:

```env
PINGONE_MFA_POLICY_ID={your-policy-id}
PINGONE_MFA_ACR_VALUE=urn:pingone:policy:Super_Banking_Step_Up_MFA_Policy
PINGONE_MFA_BINDING_MESSAGE=Super Banking step-up authentication required
MFA_STEP_UP_THRESHOLD=500.00
HIGH_VALUE_TRANSACTION_THRESHOLD=1000.00
CIBA_ENABLED=true
```

### 3. Test User Setup

Create a test user in PingOne:
- Username: `mfa-test-user`
- Email: Test email account you can access
- Role: `customer` (or `admin` for admin-specific tests)

## Test Cases

5. Observe error message
6. Request new OTP
6. Enter new OTP code
7. Verify transaction completes

**Expected Results:**
- Expired OTP is rejected with appropriate error message
