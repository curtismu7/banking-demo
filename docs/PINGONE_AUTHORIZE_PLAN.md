# PingOne Authorize — Setup Guide (BX Finance)

Step-by-step setup to connect the BX Finance banking demo to **PingOne Authorize** for real-time transaction and MCP delegation policy decisions.

**Product scope:** PingOne SaaS (`auth.pingone.com`) with the PingOne Authorize add-on.
This is NOT PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud (ForgeRock AM).

**Related:** [`PINGONE_MAY_ACT_SETUP.md`](./PINGONE_MAY_ACT_SETUP.md) — OAuth apps, token chain, resource servers, and scope configuration. Complete that guide first.

## What You Are Setting Up

PingOne Authorize enforces policy decisions at two points in the BX Finance demo:

1. **Transaction authorization** — every transfer and withdrawal is evaluated by a PingOne Authorize policy before it executes. The policy returns PERMIT, DENY, or a step-up MFA obligation.
2. **MCP first-tool gate** *(optional)* — the first MCP tool call per signed-in session is evaluated against a delegation policy. The policy validates the actor chain (`act.client_id`, nested `act.act.client_id`) and the resource audience before allowing the BX Finance AI Agent to execute tools.

> **Applications from `PINGONE_MAY_ACT_SETUP.md` (already configured):**
> - `BX Finance User` — issues Subject Tokens (PKCE login)
> - `BX Finance Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Admin` — exchanges Subject Token → MCP Token
> - `BX Finance MCP Worker` — exchanges MCP Token → Resource Token
>
> The `BX Finance Authorize Worker` created below is **separate** — it holds the credentials the BFF uses exclusively for calling PingOne Authorize decision endpoints.

---

## Part 1 — Create the Authorize Worker Application

> **PingOne Console → Applications → Applications → Add Application**

This Worker application holds the credentials the BFF uses to call PingOne Authorize decision endpoints. It is separate from `BX Finance Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Admin`, which handles token exchange.

**Overview tab:**

| Field | Type in |
|-------|---------|
| **Application name** | `BX Finance Authorize Worker` |
| **Description** | `Worker application used by the BX Finance Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) to evaluate PingOne Authorize policy decisions. Handles transaction authorization and optional MCP first-tool delegation checks. Do not use this application for token exchange or user login.` |
| **Application type** | `Worker` |

**Configuration tab → Grant Types:**

- ✅ `Client Credentials`

Click **Save**, then from the application detail page copy:
- **Client ID** → this becomes `PINGONE_AUTHORIZE_WORKER_CLIENT_ID`
- **Client Secret** → this becomes `PINGONE_AUTHORIZE_WORKER_CLIENT_SECRET`

**Assign the Authorize evaluation role:**

PingOne Authorize decision endpoints require the calling application to have appropriate environment permissions.

1. Go to **Roles** for the `BX Finance Authorize Worker` application
2. Assign **Environment Admin** *(or the specific PingOne Authorize evaluator role if your environment uses role-based Authorize access)*

> Refer to [Authorization using PingOne Authorize](https://docs.pingidentity.com/pingone/authorization_using_pingone_authorize/p1az_overview.html) for the exact role assignment required in your PingOne subscription tier.

---

## Part 2 — Define Trust Framework Attributes

> **PingOne Console → Authorize → Trust Framework → Attributes**

The Trust Framework defines the named parameters your BFF sends to Authorize when requesting a decision. Add each attribute below.

### 2a. Transaction Authorization Attributes

These attributes are sent on every transaction authorization request.

| Attribute name | Type | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| `Amount` | Number | Transaction amount in US dollars |
| `TransactionType` | String | One of: `transfer`, `withdrawal`, `deposit` |
| `UserId` | String | PingOne user ID — the `sub` claim from the user's access token |
| `Acr` | String | Authentication context class reference (step-up level already met by the user) |
| `Timestamp` | String | ISO 8601 timestamp of the transaction request |

### 2b. MCP Delegation Attributes *(for the optional MCP first-tool gate)*

These attributes are sent on the first MCP tool call per user session.

| Attribute name | Type | Description |
|----------------|------|-------------|
| `DecisionContext` | String | Always `McpFirstTool` — identifies this as an MCP delegation check |
| `UserId` | String | PingOne user ID — matches the `sub` claim on the MCP token |
| `ToolName` | String | Name of the MCP tool being invoked (e.g. `banking_get_accounts`) |
| `TokenAudience` | String | The `aud` claim of the presented MCP access token |
| `ActClientId` | String | `act.client_id` from the MCP token — the BFF actor (Client ID of `BX Finance Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Admin`) |
| `NestedActClientId` | String | `act.act.client_id` or `act.act.sub` — the upstream agent actor, when nested delegation is present |
| `McpResourceUri` | String | Expected MCP resource URI — should match `https://mcp-server.pingdemo.com` |
| `Acr` | String | Authentication context class reference |

---

## Part 3 — Create the Transaction Authorization Policy

> **PingOne Console → Authorize → Policies → Add Policy**

**Overview:**

| Field | Type in |
|-------|---------|
| **Policy name** | `BX Finance Transaction Authorization` |
| **Description** | `Evaluates BX Finance banking transaction requests. Returns PERMIT for allowed transactions, DENY for rejected ones, and a step-up MFA obligation (HTTP 428) when stronger authentication is required before the transaction can proceed.` |

**Reference policy rules** — implement these conditions in the PingOne Authorize policy editor using the Trust Framework attributes from Step 2a:

| Condition | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `Amount > 50000` | **DENY** | Blocks unusually large transfers in the demo |
| `Amount > 10000` AND `Acr` does not include MFA | **OBLIGATION — step-up** | Require MFA before approving large transfers or withdrawals |
| `TransactionType = "withdrawal"` AND `Amount > 10000` AND `Acr` does not include MFA | **OBLIGATION — step-up** | Stricter requirement for withdrawals |
| *(all other cases)* | **PERMIT** | Allow standard transactions |

> The simulated Authorize service (`ff_authorize_simulated = true`) uses these same thresholds in-process. Matching these rules in your live policy ensures consistent behavior when you toggle between simulated and live evaluation.

---

## Part 4 — Create the MCP Delegation Policy *(optional)*

> **PingOne Console → Authorize → Policies → Add Policy**

Only required if you are enabling the MCP first-tool gate (`ff_authorize_mcp_first_tool`).

**Overview:**

| Field | Type in |
|-------|---------|
| **Policy name** | `BX Finance MCP Delegation` |
| **Description** | `Evaluates MCP tool delegation requests for BX Finance. Validates the actor chain (ActClientId, NestedActClientId) and the token audience before allowing the BX Finance AI Agent to execute MCP tools on behalf of a user.` |

**Reference policy rules** — implement using Trust Framework attributes from Step 2b:

| Condition | Decision | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| `TokenAudience` does not match `McpResourceUri` | **DENY** | Token was not issued for the MCP server |
| `ActClientId` is not the Client ID of `BX Finance Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) Admin` | **DENY** | Unexpected actor — delegation chain broken |
| `UserId` is absent or empty | **DENY** | No user identity in the token |
| *(all other cases)* | **PERMIT** | Valid delegated MCP access |

---

## Part 5 — Create Decision Endpoints

### 5a. Transaction Authorization Endpoint

> **PingOne Console → Authorize → Decision Endpoints → Add Decision Endpoint**

| Field | Type in |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | `BX Finance Transaction Authorization Endpoint` |
| **Description** | `Decision endpoint for BX Finance transaction authorization. Called by the BFF on every transfer and withdrawal request. Evaluates the BX Finance Transaction Authorization policy.` |
| **Policy** | Select `BX Finance Transaction Authorization` |
| **Record recent requests** | ✅ Enable *(allows admin monitoring and demo playback)* |

Click **Save**, then copy the **Decision Endpoint ID** — this becomes `PINGONE_AUTHORIZE_DECISION_ENDPOINT_ID`.

---

### 5b. MCP Delegation Endpoint *(optional)*

> **PingOne Console → Authorize → Decision Endpoints → Add Decision Endpoint**

| Field | Type in |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | `BX Finance MCP Delegation Endpoint` |
| **Description** | `Decision endpoint for BX Finance MCP first-tool delegation authorization. Called by the BFF on the first MCP tool invocation per user session. Evaluates the BX Finance MCP Delegation policy.` |
| **Policy** | Select `BX Finance MCP Delegation` |
| **Record recent requests** | ✅ Enable |

Click **Save**, then copy the **Decision Endpoint ID** — this becomes `PINGONE_AUTHORIZE_MCP_DECISION_ENDPOINT_ID`.

---

## Part 6 — Configure Environment Variables

Set these in your `.env` file (`banking_api_server/`) or as Vercel environment variables.

| Variable | Where to find the value | Required? |
|----------|------------------------|-----------|
| `PINGONE_AUTHORIZE_WORKER_CLIENT_ID` | Client ID of `BX Finance Authorize Worker` (Step 1) | Required |
| `PINGONE_AUTHORIZE_WORKER_CLIENT_SECRET` | Client Secret of `BX Finance Authorize Worker` (Step 1) | Required |
| `PINGONE_AUTHORIZE_DECISION_ENDPOINT_ID` | Decision Endpoint ID from Step 5a | Required for transactions |
| `PINGONE_AUTHORIZE_MCP_DECISION_ENDPOINT_ID` | Decision Endpoint ID from Step 5b | Required for MCP gate |

> These can also be set through the Admin UI at **Admin → Configuration → PingOne Authorize** without redeploying.

---

## Part 7 — Enable Feature Flags

Enable and adjust flags from **Admin → Feature Flags** or the `/demo-data` page.

| Flag | What it does | Recommended starting value |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|
| `ff_authorize_simulated` | Use in-process simulated Authorize — no PingOne API call. Use this to verify the UI and flow before connecting live PingOne. | `ON` first, then `OFF` once live PingOne is configured |
| `ff_authorize_fail_open` | Allow transactions to proceed when the Authorize API call fails (timeout, misconfiguration) | `ON` during initial setup; reassess for production |
| `ff_authorize_deposits` | Also apply Authorize to deposit transactions (default: transfers + withdrawals only) | `OFF` by default |
| `ff_authorize_mcp_first_tool` | Evaluate PingOne Authorize on the first MCP tool call per session | `OFF` until Step 5b is configured |

---

## Part 8 — Verify

### 8a. Verify transaction authorization

1. Log in as a standard user
2. Navigate to **Send Money**
3. Submit a transfer of **$500** → expect **PERMIT** (transaction succeeds)
4. Submit a transfer of **$60,000** → expect **DENY** (transaction blocked)
5. In **Admin → Monitoring → PingOne Authorize → Recent Decisions** — confirm decision records appear with PERMIT/DENY outcomes and the correct Trust Framework parameters (`Amount`, `TransactionType`, `UserId`)

### 8b. Verify MCP delegation *(if enabled)*

1. Set `PINGONE_AUTHORIZE_MCP_DECISION_ENDPOINT_ID` and enable `ff_authorize_mcp_first_tool`
2. Log in as a user and open the **AI Agent**
3. Send a message that triggers a tool call (e.g. "show my accounts")
4. In **Admin → Monitoring → PingOne Authorize → Recent Decisions** — confirm a `McpFirstTool` evaluation appears with `TokenAudience`, `ActClientId`, and `UserId` populated

---

## How the BFF Calls Authorize

For reference — the BFF sends a `POST` to the decision endpoint with Trust Framework parameters in this shape:

**Transaction request:**
```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "Amount": 1000,
    "TransactionType": "transfer",
    "UserId": "<user-sub>",
    "Acr": "urn:pingidentity:authentication:user:password",
    "Timestamp": "2026-03-30T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

**MCP first-tool request:**
```json
{
  "parameters": {
    "DecisionContext": "McpFirstTool",
    "UserId": "<user-sub>",
    "ToolName": "banking_get_accounts",
    "TokenAudience": "https://mcp-server.pingdemo.com",
    "ActClientId": "<client-id-of-bx-finance-bff-admin>",
    "NestedActClientId": "",
    "McpResourceUri": "https://mcp-server.pingdemo.com"
  }
}
```

The endpoint URL is:
```
POST https://auth.pingone.com/{environmentId}/as/decisionEndpoints/{decisionEndpointId}
```

Authorization uses a Bearer token obtained via Client Credentials from `BX Finance Authorize Worker`.
